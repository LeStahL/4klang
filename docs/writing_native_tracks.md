# Writing Tracks for 4k Intros with Sointu

Sointu (esp. the non-native version) allows the design of instruments that do not export to x86 asm code (because of stack size limit, performance limitations, etc.). This document covers the common limitations that musicians need to be aware of if their track is intended for a 4k intro.

# x87 Stack Overflows

# Decrease File Size
* Pattern reuse
* Correct RPP setting

# Avoiding GM.DLS sampler on Linux
