    Experimenting with the unison oscillators. Note that all units are in stereo. Try adding even more detune.

    Oscillators: Each oscillator is stereo and has unison of 3 oscillators. The unison oscillators are in addition to the standard oscillator so there altogether 4 oscillators per channel = 8 oscillators. Thus, with three oscillator units, there is a total of 24 saw tooth oscillators, 12 per channel.
    Noise-filter: Add some high end hiss to the sound.
    Filter: High pass filter to remove the low end.
    Outaux: Assumes the aux channel is sent to global reverb.
